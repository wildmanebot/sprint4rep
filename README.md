# Sprint 4 Project
This is the project for Practicum's Data Science Bootcamp Sprint 4. In this project, a used vehicle dataset is cleaned and analyzed. The focus was relatively open-ended, and was meant to show my capabilities in using github, pandas and plotly libraries, and the streamlit library. It was also an introduction to Render's online web app service, where some of this project's results and visualizations can be found. 

The Render web app for this project can be found at the following link: https://sprint4.onrender.com

You can also take a look at the project's Jupyter notebook by installing VS code and opening the ipynb file included in this repository.

Running the streamlit app locally will require you to have the pandas, plotly, and streamlit libraries installed in your local python environment. To run the streamlit app, open your environment's terminal, navigate to the cloned repository folder, and enter the following: 

streamlit run app.py
